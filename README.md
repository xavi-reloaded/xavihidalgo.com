I made this template to build a simple personal static site with bootstrap 4.
As many times, I checked first github to look for good solutions and I found this nice project: [clarity](https://ifvictr.github.io/clarity/)

New to Bootstrap? [Visit the homepag](https://getbootstrap.com/) or read the [getting started guide](https://getbootstrap.com/docs/4.1/getting-started/introduction/)
